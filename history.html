<h4 align = "left"><blockquote><p>German language, German Deutsch, official language of both Germany and Austria and one of the three official languages of Switzerland.
   German belongs to the West Germanic group of the Indo-European language family, along with English, Frisian, and Dutch (Netherlandic, Flemish).</p>

 <p>Historically, German falls into three main periods:
   <ul>
     <li> Old German (c.A.D. 750–c.A.D. 1050)</li>
     <li> Middle German (c.1050–c.1500)</li>
      <li> Modern German (c.1500 to the present)</li>
    </ul>
         The earliest existing records in German date back to about A.D. 750. In this first period, local dialects were used in writing, and there was no standard language.
    In the middle period a relatively uniform written language developed in government after the various chancelleries of the Holy Roman Empire began, in the 14th century, to use a combination of certain dialects of Middle High German in place of the Latin that until then had dominated official writings.
